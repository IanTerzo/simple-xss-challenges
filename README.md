# Simple XSS Challenges

In this repository, you'll find three beginner-level XSS challenges that progressively ramp up in difficulty.

## Get started
Clone this repo or access the challenges directly on my [GitHub Page](https://ianterzo.github.io/simple-xss-challenges/).

New to XSS? Be sure to check out the [OWASP XSS Guide](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/).

## Final note
I've made this project entirely using vanilla JavaScript, keeping the code as simple as possible. 

Remember to have fun!
